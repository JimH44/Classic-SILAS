# SILAS
SILAS stands for Smart Interactive Layout Assistent for Scripture. It is a Microsoft Word template that provides style improvements and macros to improve the formatting of RTF files exported from Paratext and other Scripture editing programs.

It can also provide help in adding consistent USFM backslash codes to Word or text documents that have been prepared without formatting that is consistent with USFM standards. The resultant files can be imported into Paratext.

It is distributed as a Windows installer, which is built using Inno Setup. The version number is in two parts -- the version number of USFM that it uses followed by a build number. For example, 2.3-1.23 builds to USFM version 2.35, and it is build 1.23 of that version.
