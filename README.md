# SILAS
SILAS stands for Smart Interactive Layout Assistent for Scripture. It is a Microsoft Word template that provides style improvements and macros to improve the formatting of RTF files exported from Paratext, Adapt It, KeyIt and other Scripture editing programs.

It can also provide help in adding consistent USFM backslash codes to Word or text documents that have been prepared without formatting that is consistent with USFM standards. The resultant files can be imported into Paratext.

It is distributed as a Windows installer, which is built using Inno Setup. The version number is in two parts -- the version number of USFM that it uses followed by a build number. For example, 2.3-1.23 builds to USFM version 2.35, and it is build 1.23 of that version.

Currently this works only in Windows versions of Word, from Word 97 onwards.

The distribution includes the latest versions of USFM.sty, along with USFM_draft.sty, usfm_sb-notes.sty and usfm_sb-sidebars.sty, and copies them into the Paratext settings folder.

The stylenames in the template conform to the latest version of USFM.sty, and there is an input conversion routine that will update stylenames, from right back to 1998 versions. This routine will even convert from the stylenames output by Fieldworks Translation Editor.

Why not just print the RTF file that comes out of my Scripture editing program? See the Wiki page Benefits.
