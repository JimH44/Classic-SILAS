Revision History for Silas.DOT

NEEDED

-Provide drop-down list of 3-letter booknames in ID form?
	The bookname is used for deciding where to put section breaks,
	and it is visible in ID footers in Proofs. 
	We could do it with a txt file similar to Recent_Styles.txt.
-Add horizontal rule between intro and Scr text even if single-column?
-check into more automated picture placement (see Toolbox macro by Steve White)
-Make input boxes save as Unicode (if appropriate)
-Research a way of having \s# and \ip# and \iex be in side boxes, 
	(but not verse numbers in the margin -- that one's too hard).
-Check Kim's loop in USFM2Styles with \b
-Add ability to print first and last verse numbers in page headers,
	as well as chapter numbers.
-Work out why attaching Silas to RTF attached to an email
	can't find Custom_Styles.txt nor show folder name.
-For each centred table style, make its paragraph centred.
-Fix bug dealing with Vn nr with two dots in it

Fixed problem for some South American systems, where the national language settings

No longer using wildcards to reduce duplicate fixed spaces.

Silas 2.103-1.08 by Jim, 7 Oct 2008
====================================
Reduced duplication of forms for 
	adding a new language
	modifying an existing language
    Each job uses dbLanguageInfo, 
    but sets the public variable NewLanguage appropriately first.
Files made with USFM_draft.sty no longer produce warning messages,
	but still load "Recent_Styles.txt" to update stylenames.
This item removed from the ToDo list:
-To solve the problem of lines not matching up, 
	think about having a blank line with "keep with next" attribute
	before each section heading, instead of setting Space before in the \s style.
		(This proved hard to do in Word,
		so let the typesetters use real typesetting software,
		and translators use Word with SILAS for quick printouts.)
Fixed a couple of loop errors in processing chapter codes 
	that don't have appropriately-formatted text after them.
Worked around problem with wildcard search not working to find multiple fixed spaces.

Silas 2.103-1.06 by Jim, 22 Aug 2008

	after FixCodes has been run, and errors introduced. Also changed what happens
	if a paragraph code found within a paragraph (word 2003 bug).

	when the dialog is initialized.
Added tests and control files to update files made with SCR_V2.dot and SCRPNG98.dot.
Minor improvement to instructions in Install Silas.doc when automatic procedure fails.
Changed the check for chapter style running too far, to allow "Sapta 6" in files.
Added macros to reduce multiple spaces and join lines into a paragraph,
	with items on the USFM2Stles menu.

	could cause an endless loop.
USFM2Styles now also saves document as .doc at the end, suggesting same filename as SFM version.
Resolved problem in MakeCoverDocument in case where different sections have different margins --
	getting the margin from the whole document produced the undefined value of "9999999".
	Now gets the right margin from the first section in the document, the title page.
	Fixed same problem in IncreaseRightMargin and DecreaseRightMargin,
	and also prevented the user from increasing or decreasing too far.
Removed line at top of footer in newly-made cover documents.
Fixed problem with text in cover documnent being in the wrong font 
	by basing the coverdocument on the booklet document, rather than the template.
Fixed bug that double-sided layout for proof printouts would only be done 
	if right margin set to "extrawide" (because End If in the wrong place).
Moved macros that won't run in old verions of Word into separate modules, "VBA10plus" etc.
Adjusted some macros to make them work in older versions of Word.
Improved layout of dbPTFont.
Fixed setting default value of ExportedFrom in AttachSILASFormattingTemplate.
Tweaked some messages in AttachSILASTemplate in Install Silas.doc.

Separated usage instructions from template file full of macros,
	to reduce the attach time a bit.
Added more help for Word 2007 users to info file, "Using Silas.doc".

Removed from todo list:
-(eventually) add custom \z* style support, probably just copy the style 
	into the template so it doesn't hang up. 
	Perhaps note to user about adding to template & formatting it as desired 
	so it'll update next time.
   Removed because the template won't mess up, having extra styles -- it'll only mess up
	if some style that it is expecting isn't there. And there's no need to
	reload it from the template when the template is attached to set the formatting,
	because the user can do that in USFM.sty, and Pt will export it properly.

Silas 2.101-1.14 by Jim, 2 Mar 2008

====================================
Button in Proofs dialog to bring up checking table for editing.
Inserted checking table is resized to fit margins, like old v was.
Install modif. so if Custom_styles.txt and Checking Table.doc are already in template folder, they're not 
	overridden. Then they won't have to retrieve their old versions every time they install a new Silas v.
	If we add s.t. or make a major change to one of these files we can have that Install v copy the files.

Silas 2.05-1.026 by Jim, 3 Feb 2007

====================================
Fixed problem with footnote spacing. Also made Footer and checking table styles stay single-spaced.

Fixed problem with Booklet Macro installation.

Changed Latest_Styles.txt to Custom_Styles.txt. This control file is used for customizing USFM standard, so 
it's labeled accordingly. The other control files are used for updating to the latest "Standard" stylenames
in USFM.STY as distributed by the PT team.

Added subs ZoomSet and ZoomRecall to return to previous view.zoom after running jobs. Cleaned up subs to use
ZoomSet at start, and SetDefaultView (which calls ZoomRecall among other things) rather than 
ActiveDocument...View=PageOrPrintView at end of subs. Then if user sets a different zoom it won't change 
after every job. Also cleaned up a few places where screen updating caused a flashing image 
(switched order of calls at end of some subs).

===================================
Changed the name to Silas -- Smart Interactive Layout Assistant for Scripture
This is the first attempt at a Silas distribution -- watch things break!

-add msg to DoubleColumns if no ID line is found so people know why it didn't work. Or add an ID --done.
	but... EVEN THO THE COLUMNS AREN'T CHANGED, NrColumns=2 is set if no ID line. 
	I guess this case won't occur again since a fake ID line is added by LoadLangData. Right?
-add Jim's stylename changes for TE output to Attach (need to get a version posted and this may not be finalized yet)
-add stylename changes for minor USFM.STY 2.4x versions (into CheckUSFMVersion) for AI users. This could be done in 
	CheckUsfmVersion.
