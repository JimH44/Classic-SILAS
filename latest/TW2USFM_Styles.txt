Custom_Styles.txt -- control file for standardizing non-standard style names.

Comment lines have no semi-colons in them.
Change lines have the old stylename that should be replaced first,
then after the semicolon the new replacement name.

Use this control file if you have some non-standard stylenames,
using Recent_Styles.txt as a model.
