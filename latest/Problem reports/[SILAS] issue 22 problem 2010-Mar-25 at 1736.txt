Please answer the following questions:
What did you do and what happened?

I installed Silas, but I had to do the attaching manually. The Silas icon appeared in the toolbar, then I exited Word and created a document from Paratext and the icon wasn’t visible. The option is in Tools … just no icon. The small toolbar with the formatting options does appear.

What did you expect to happen?

To get an icon I can use … I use it quite a lot.

Please be very specific about error messages -- 
the exact wording or a screen shot help a lot.
To send a screenshot, operate the Print Screen key
(which sometimes requires that you hold down a key called 'Fn' at the seme time.)
This will put a screenshot in the clipboard.
Do START->Run->mspaint, then in that program, do Ctrl-V to paste in the screenshot.
Do File->Save As and choose the type PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
and attach that file to your email message along with this document.

No error message.
