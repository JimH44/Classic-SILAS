Custom_Styles.txt -- control file for standardizing non-standard style names.

Comment lines have no semi-colons in them.
Change lines have the old stylename that should be replaced first,
then after the semicolon the new replacement name, like this:
abcxyx - This is a nonexistent USFM code; abcxyz - Sample nonexistent USFM code

Use this control file if you have some non-standard stylenames,
using Recent_Styles.txt as a model.
