It seems you have not removed 2.301-1.02, so let's work on that. I looked up on the internet how to do that in Windows 7, and found these steps:
1. Close all Word windows.
2. Tap the Windows key or click the windows symbol at the bottom left of the screen, where the word START used to be. This should open the start menu.
3. In the right-hand column, just below Computer, you should see Control Panel. Click it.
4. In Control Panel, click Programs, then Uninstall a program.
5. Find SILAS and click it, then click Uninstall/Change and remove it.
6. Look for any other versions of SILAS and remove them as well.
